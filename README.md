# Coding Exercise: Secret
A Secret encapsulates a function that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. Secret is a given but you donâ€™t know its implementation. In Java or a language of your choice, write an application that determines if Secret is an additive function secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y) for all combinations of prime numbers less than N where N is also a given.

Assume you are going to ship this code. Use your judgement to determine what you need to include. Document any assumptions or choices you make in your implementation. Also, include an explanation of your choice of language.

#Documentation
To view documentation you will need to download the "Documentation" folder. Once downloaded, open index.html for Javadoc on this solution.

#Implementation
See Secret.java in the "Implementation" folder.
